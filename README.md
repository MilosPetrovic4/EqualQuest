# Equal Quest

## Game Description
Equal Quest is a puzzle game that draws from fundamental math concepts in order to create fun thought provoking puzzles. The goal of the game is to form truthful arithmetic equations by making use of every digit and operator piece. Put on your thinking cap and solve these number jumbled brain teasers!

## Instructions
Click and drag the pieces across the board and place them next to each other to form equations, if an equation is true, it will light up green. But make sure you find a way to use every single piece. Rules: 1. Must create one or multiple truthful equations 2. Must use each character including all digits and operators in order to complete a level 3. When multiple equality operator are given (ex: “=”, “=” or “=”, “<”), the expressions must be separate from each other (ex: 1=1, 1=1) NOT placed together (1=1=1) 4. The minus “-” operator is exclusively for subtraction (ex: 5-4, 3-9), it can not be used to make a number negative (ex: -6), but negative numbers can arise from subtraction 5. Placing a zero in front of a number is legal (ex: 8 = 08)
